					<p>Ripples of Change is an outpatient community mental health program offering a unique range of hand tailored counseling services to children, adolescents and families. While “talk” is still the traditional method of exchange in therapy and counseling at ROC, we add the element of expressive arts to better meet the needs of individuals.  While one individual may be more visual, another may be more tactile, and so forth. We meet these needs by introducing our clients to various modes of expressive arts with the aim of enhancing the therapeutic process. Our team utilizes this approach through Art, Music, Movement, Play and Animal Assistance.</p>
